IoT Based Attendance System using Face Detection during Pandemic refers to an 

IOT based project to mark attendance automatically using Face Identification and 

Detection. This project is built under abnormal conditions faced by the entire world 

named “COVID-19” during 2020-2021, while we are remotely thinking about to solve

a big problem that can be faced by Industries, Educational Sectors etc. to mark 

attendance of corresponding workers, students. Automatic attendance saves time and 

efficiently manages data but some existing devices i.e Biometric fingerprint based 

systems would not work in this pandemic conditions as fingerprint can also have viruses 

that can infect others, so to overcome this problem we have identified a project to mark 

attendance using Face Detection functionality.
